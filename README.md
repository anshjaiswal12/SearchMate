 ProfileHunter - Automated Web Search Tool

ProfileHunter is a Python-based tool that automates the process of searching for people online by taking a list of names and appending an organization or community name to each search query. This allows you to quickly find profiles of individuals associated with a specific community or organization, saving time and increasing productivity.



 Features:
- Automates Google search queries by combining names with a follow-up string (e.g., an organization or community name).
- Opens a new browser tab for each search result.
- Saves time by eliminating the need for manual searches across multiple people.
- Simple and efficient, requiring minimal setup.



 Use Case Example:
Suppose you have a list of names like:
- Ansh Jaiswal, John Doe, Jane Smith

And you want to search for their profiles related to:
- GSOC CERN

By entering "GSOC CERN" as the follow-up string, the script will automatically open browser tabs to search for each person with the string "GSOC CERN", enabling you to find their profiles quickly.



 How It Works:
1. Input a list of names separated by commas (e.g., "Ansh Jaiswal, John Doe").
2. Input a follow-up string that describes the organization or community you're interested in (e.g., "GSOC CERN").
3. The script will open Google search results for each name + follow-up string combination, making it easy to find profiles and connect with people.



 Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProfileHunter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd ProfileHunter
   ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed. This script requires Python 3.x.



 Usage:
1. Open a terminal and run the script:
   ```bash
   python SearchMate.py
   ```
2. You’ll be prompted to input the follow-up string and the list of names.
3. The script will automatically search for the profiles using Google and open the results in a browser.
